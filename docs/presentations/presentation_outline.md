  - Provides actionable recommendations
- **One-click security assessment** for any SaaS API

## Slide 4: Key Features
1. **Intelligent API Scanner**
   - Auto-discovery of endpoints
   - Deep authentication analysis
   - Security header validation
   - Rate limiting detection

2. **Visual Risk Mapping**
   - Interactive heatmaps
   - Risk severity indicators
   - Trend analysis over time

3. **Actionable Insights**
   - Prioritized recommendations
   - Step-by-step remediation guides
   - Integration with ticketing systems

## Slide 5: How It Works
### Three Simple Steps
