# API Risk Visualizer - Pitch Script

## Opening (30 seconds)
"Imagine you're a security engineer at a fast-growing SaaS company. You have dozens of APIs powering your product, but you have no idea which ones are vulnerable. Sound familiar? 

87% of organizations experienced an API security breach last year. Why? Because current tools are complex, time-consuming, and require deep security expertise.

We're building the API Risk Visualizer - making API security as simple as checking your dashboard."

## Problem Deep Dive (45 seconds)
"APIs are everywhere - they power modern software. But they're also the #1 attack vector for hackers. 

Current solutions? Either expensive enterprise tools that take weeks to deploy, or manual testing that takes days and misses critical vulnerabilities.

Security teams are overwhelmed. Developers don't have time. And APIs remain unsecured."

## Solution Introduction (45 seconds)
"API Risk Visualizer changes everything. 

Just enter your API URL, and within minutes, our tool:
- Automatically discovers every endpoint
- Tests for common vulnerabilities
- Creates a visual risk map you can actually understand
- Gives you step-by-step fixes

No security PhD required. Just actionable insights."

## Demo Teaser (30 seconds)
"Let me show you how simple it is. 

[Point to mockup]
One click scan. Real-time analysis. This heatmap shows exactly where your risks are. Red means critical - fix now. Green means secure. 

And here - personalized recommendations ranked by severity. Each with clear remediation steps."

## Market & Impact (30 seconds)
"This isn't just a hackathon project. It's a $7.8 billion market opportunity. 

Every company with an API needs this. That's hundreds of thousands of potential customers.

We can reduce API breaches by 60% and save security teams 20 hours per week."

## Call to Action (30 seconds)
"In the next 24 hours, we're building a working prototype that will scan real APIs and generate real security insights.

We're not just identifying problems - we're providing solutions. Making the internet more secure, one API at a time.

Join us in revolutionizing API security. Thank you."

## Q&A Prep - Common Questions

### Q: How is this different from existing tools?
A: "Great question. Tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP are powerful but complex. They're built for security experts. We're built for everyone. Think of us as the 'Grammarly for API security' - simple, visual, actionable."

### Q: What types of vulnerabilities can you detect?
A: "We focus on the OWASP API Top 10 - things like broken authentication, excessive data exposure, lack of rate limiting. These account for 90% of API breaches. We start with the basics that have the biggest impact."

### Q: How do you handle false positives?
A: "Our ML model learns from user feedback. Plus, we provide confidence scores for each finding. Critical issues are always manually verifiable with one click."

### Q: What's your business model?
A: "Freemium SaaS. Free tier for individual developers scanning up to 5 APIs. Teams pay $99-999/month based on API volume and features. Enterprise gets custom pricing with SLA."

### Q: Can this integrate with CI/CD pipelines?
A: "Absolutely. Post-hackathon, we'll build GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Jenkins plugins. Shift security left without shifting responsibility."
