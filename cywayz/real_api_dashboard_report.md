# Cywayz API Security Dashboard & Reporting System

---

## Chapter 1: Introduction

### 1.1. State of Art Developments
The rapid proliferation of APIs in modern software ecosystems has led to increased attack surfaces and security challenges. State-of-the-art solutions now leverage AI/ML for vulnerability detection, real-time analytics, and automated remediation. Tools like Cywayz integrate advanced discovery, risk scoring, and reporting, surpassing traditional static scanners by providing dynamic, context-aware insights and actionable guidance.

### 1.2. Motivation
APIs are the backbone of digital transformation, but their security is often overlooked. High-profile breaches have demonstrated the need for continuous, intelligent API security. The motivation behind Cywayz is to provide a comprehensive, AI-driven platform that not only discovers and assesses API risks but also empowers organizations with real-time analytics and automated, expert-level remediation.

### 1.3. Problem Statement
Existing API security tools often lack real-time feedback, deep discovery, and actionable remediation. Manual analysis is time-consuming and error-prone. There is a need for an integrated system that automates endpoint discovery, vulnerability assessment, risk analytics, and reporting, while leveraging AI for both detection and remediation.

### 1.4. Objectives
- Develop a real-time, interactive dashboard for API risk visualization
- Automate API endpoint discovery using multiple techniques
- Integrate AI/ML for risk scoring and remediation guidance
- Provide comprehensive, exportable reports (PDF, JSON, CSV)
- Ensure extensibility for future security standards and technologies

### 1.5. Scope
The project covers:
- API endpoint discovery (Swagger, crawling, brute force, robots.txt)
- Vulnerability scanning (auth, misconfig, parameter, sensitive data, etc.)
- Real-time dashboard with analytics and network visualization
- AI/ML-powered risk scoring and remediation
- Automated PDF report generation
- Compliance mapping (OWASP, PCI DSS, GDPR, etc.)

## Chapter 2: Methodology

### 2.1. Introduction
The methodology combines software engineering best practices with advanced AI/ML techniques for security analysis. The system is modular, scalable, and designed for extensibility.

### 2.2. Relevant Technical and Mathematical Details
- **API Discovery:**
  - Passive crawling, brute force, Swagger/OpenAPI parsing, robots.txt analysis
  - Algorithms for endpoint aggregation and deduplication
- **Vulnerability Assessment:**
  - Rule-based and ML-based detection for auth, misconfig, parameter tampering, etc.
  - Severity scoring (static and ML-enhanced)
- **Risk Scoring:**
  - Weighted sum of vulnerabilities, normalized to a 0-1000 scale
  - ML models (e.g., regression, classification) for risk prediction
  - CVSS mapping for standardized scoring
- **AI Remediation:**
  - LLM prompt engineering for actionable, stepwise remediation
  - Fallback logic for static recommendations
- **Visualization:**
  - D3.js force-directed graphs, heatmaps, radar and doughnut charts
  - Real-time updates via WebSockets
- **Mathematical Formulas:**
  - Risk Score = Σ (SeverityWeight × VulnerabilityCount)
  - ML metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, CVSS Correlation

### 2.3. Summary
The methodology ensures comprehensive coverage of API security, leveraging both deterministic and probabilistic (AI/ML) approaches for detection, scoring, and remediation.
